# Wails v0.18.5

This version brings better handling of shutdown behaviour.

A *huge* thank you to everyone that was involved in this release!

## Wails Shutdown

It is now possible to create methods on structs that will get called during application shutdown. Any struct methods with the signature `WailsShutdown()` will be called during shutdown.

Example:
```go
  type MyStruct struct {
    runtime *wails.Runtime
  }

  // This method will be called during application startup
  func (s *MyStruct) WailsInit(runtime *wails.Runtime) error {
    // Save runtime
    s.runtime = runtime

    // Allocate some resources...

    return nil
  }

  // This method will be called during application startup
  func (s *MyStruct) WailsShutdown() {
    
    // De-Allocate some resources...

    return nil
  }

```

We will be spending the next month improving documentation and bug fixing. Please let us know what bugs you find and we will look at them with the highest priority!

See you at v1.0.0!
