# Wails v0.17.0

This version brings with it a new template, a new supported Linux distribution and a helpful utility. Unfortunately, Windows support is again proving problematic. If there is anyone out there who would like to help with Windows support, please get in touch! We are looking to fix the Windows issues and do a point release.

A *huge* thank you to everyone that was involved in this release!

## Angular 8 Template (Mac & Linux)

After his awesome React template last release, [admin_3.exe](https://github.com/bh90210) has come up with the goods again and delivered an Angular 8 template for the Wails community! Thanks admin_3.exe! üëèüéâ

**REQUIRES NODE 10.8+**

## Debian Support

We continue to expand our supported platform list with the introduction of Debian support. Versions 9 and 10 tested so far. Big shout out to [iceleo-com](https://github.com/iceleo-com) for the original request and testing!

## Distribution Support Request Wizard!

</p>

We have added a feature whereby when you try and run `wails init` on an unsupported Linux distribution, it will now prompt you to submit a support request. This will automatically generate a github request with the distribution name, version and discovery method. There is literally nothing more you have to do than click the 'submit' button in the browser window that opens for you. This really helps us to get your distribution supported.

## Documentation Site Revamp

The tireless [admin_3.exe](https://github.com/bh90210) has revamped the documentation site. We hope the improved structure and layout will help those who are new to the project get a better head start.
